# IntuitRisks

IntuitRisks is a Bachelor’s project developed in collaboration with IntuitSens, a company specializing in crisis management, based in Penthalaz (VD). This project was completed as part of the Bachelor’s studies at the School of Engineering and Management of Vaud (HEIG-VD).

## Context

In an increasingly uncertain economic environment marked by various risks (such as health crises, cyberattacks, natural disasters, etc.), businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), face significant challenges in safeguarding their operations. SMEs, often with limited resources, require risk management solutions that are simple, accessible, and effective to proactively prevent and manage crises.

## Objectives

-   Develop a functional prototype allowing users to register, configure their organization, and select relevant risks in less than 15 to 20 minutes.
-   Simplify and optimize the user interface to ensure quick adoption and high user satisfaction.
-   Lay the groundwork for future features, such as generating emergency plans and risk response strategies.
